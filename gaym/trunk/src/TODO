These are in no particular order --- edit/add as you see fit!

PROTOCOL FEATURES

1. The "Room List" operation should parse the /messenger/config.txt file from gay.com. We need to hide as much as possible 
the "real" channel names (Like #557 is Sacramento). As the room list is generated, it should automatically display the 
multiple rooms associated with a locale, so that the user can select one. The user should have the option of adding EITHER 
the #xxx=* room, OR a particular #xxx=x room, to the buddy list. 

2. gay.com buddy list integration. An option to "auto-add" NOTIFY buddies.

3. chatclient buddy list import option built in.

4. Split-phase operation notifiers. For example.... if you click to join a 
channel, there may be a delay if, for example, 
the buddy list is updating. This is NOT acceptable from a UI standpoint, since feedback should occur as soon as possible. 
So, we need to incorporate notification dialogs for these operations, to give the user instant feedback. 


NON PROTOCOL FEATURES (Probably a "gaym++" plugin that provides these features.)

1. Bio Line display in chat window.

2. Thumbnail in "chat" windows for selected user. Again -- this will need to be a separate plugin, since it will require 
gtk-specific code (most likely)

3. Room namelist sorting -- another non-proto option. I'm not even sure if a plugin can affect this, based on the way it 
seems to be implemented :( Might end up being a wish on gaim.sourceforge.net. Or I'll just write a damned patch myself.

4. "Extended" profiles -- get the entire profile "meat" without all of the gay.com advertising and bric-a-brac.

5. Join/part message on/off


Some thoughts from deckrider:
============================

progress bar hang on roomlist...use g_idle_add ()

private photo doesn't show next to buddy when I have been given
permission to see it

activate link to web page for report user

integrate server buddy, bookmarks, hotlists, im hot lists, ignore lists

activate privacy/block users in gui (ignore lists from above)

make roomlist show "room name:1" similar to yahoo

see what native2ascii does when the native file has "\u00F1" in it
along with the actual character that that sequence represents.

get rid of signals in prpl (no other prpl needs them, why do we?)

handle all "unknowns" shown in the debug window

user-controllable ignores (eliminate hard-coded ignores)

Make it so users enter free form text to chat and this gets converted
to a member-created-room style by replacing spaces with underscores
and appending #_ at the beginning and =1 (or some number) at the end.
Probably the users should be required to enter ":1" or some number at the
end or receive an error, since the server doesn't appear to send one at
at first glance (verify before acting).

Getting these in red, not sure what it is:
gaim_utf8_strcasecmp: One or both parameters are invalid UTF8
