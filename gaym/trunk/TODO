When these are DONE, please move to the very bottom of the list.

TODO
====

- add gaym_bot_check(), patterned similar to gaym_privacy_check() that
  takes a list of strings/patterns the user can enter in GayM
  preferences and then looks to see if a match is found in the nick's
  bio.  If there is, returns TRUE (or FALSE?), if not, then the
  opposite.

- "Tools | Account Actions | Change Bio" should not obliterate the
  "^AS|A|L" but only the bio string.  Currently, the S|A|L gets
  obliterated which means no one else can see it.

- Make it so users enter free form text to chat and this gets converted
  to a member-created-room style by replacing spaces with underscores
  and appending #_ at the beginning and =1 (or some number) at the end.
  Probably the users should be required to enter ":1" or some number at
  the end or receive an error, since the server doesn't appear to send
  one at at first glance (verify before acting).

- integrate server buddy, bookmarks, hotlists, im hot lists, ignore
  lists (below is two version of this)

- gay.com buddy list integration. An option to "auto-add" NOTIFY
  buddies (really, we already have the complete list in config.txt
  without waiting for NOTIFY).

- Synchronize buddy list with server.  This is easy to do.  Already, we
  have the server's view of the list in config.txt.  Adding a new buddy
  to the server is basically an http GET.  Some thought however needs to
  be given to user interface design, in terms of whether we should sync
  to the server's buddies, and/or bookmarks, and/or hotlist.

- Bio Line display in chat window. (I think this can be done using
  TOPIC when the user's name is clicked.  I think yahoo may do something
  so its not editable, which would help us here.  So this could be a
  PROTOCOL PLUGIN)

- The "Room List" operation should parse the /messenger/config.txt file
  from gay.com. We need to hide as much as possible the "real" channel
  names (Like #557 is Sacramento). As the room list is generated, it
  should automatically display the multiple rooms associated with a
  locale, so that the user can select one. The user should have the
  option of adding EITHER the #xxx=* room, OR a particular #xxx=x room,
  to the buddy list.   (I think this is somewhat done, but not sure)

- Split-phase operation notifiers. For example.... if you click to join
  a channel, there may be a delay if, for example, the buddy list is
  updating. This is NOT acceptable from a UI standpoint, since feedback
  should occur as soon as possible.  So, we need to incorporate
  notification dialogs for these operations, to give the user instant
  feedback. 

- Thumbnail in "chat" windows for selected user. Again -- this will need
  to be a separate plugin, since it will require gtk-specific code (most
  likely)

- Room namelist sorting -- another non-proto option. I'm not even sure
  if a plugin can affect this, based on the way it seems to be
  implemented :( Might end up being a wish on gaim.sourceforge.net. Or
  I'll just write a damned patch myself.

- "Extended" profiles -- get the entire profile "meat" without all of
  the gay.com advertising and bric-a-brac.

- Progress bar hang on roomlist...use g_idle_add ()

- Private photo doesn't show next to buddy when I have been given
  permission to see it

- check if there is another way to retrieve thumbnails without the extra
  signal connect

- there seem to be a lot of NOTIFYs that gaym ignores ... might be nice
  to use them instead of polling (or in addition to)

- handle all "unknowns" shown in the debug window

- Getting these in red, not sure what it is: gaim_utf8_strcasecmp: One
  or both parameters are invalid UTF8  (still valid?)

- Need a better way to coordinate VERSION between configure.ac an win32
  builds (which do not currently use autoconf).  Perhaps win32 can
  eventually use autoconf/automake, but I don't yet know how
  cross-compiler builds would work with this.

DONE
====

- Add windows installer package

- Connect link to web page for report user to Warn button in Gaim

- activate privacy/block users in gui

- Join/part message on/off

- make roomlist show "room name:1" similar to yahoo

- see what native2ascii does when the native file has "\u00F1" in it
  along with the actual character that that sequence represents.
