An explanation of privacy settings as implemented in GayM:

Gaim Privacy Setting Options (only one of the following may be selected):

   Tools->Privacy->Allow all users to contact me
   Tools->Privacy->Allow all users on my buddy list
   Tools->Privacy->Allow only the users below (permit list)
   Tools->Privacy->Block all users
   Tools->Privacy->Block only the users below (deny list)

Widgets that interact with privacy settings:

   Chat Room->Ignore the user (ignore/unignore toggle)
   Instant Message->Block (add to deny list)

Gaim Privacy Principles

   If a member is blocked via Gaim Privacy, you will never see anything
   from them, either any chat rooms or in an instant message.  GayM
   Preferences will not override it.

Chat Room->Ignore the user

   This will ignore the user in that chat room only, and only while that
   chat room window is open--if you close the chat room and re-open it,
   the user is no longer ignore--if you close the chat room and re-open
   it, the user is no longer ignored.  The user can always IM you and is
   not ignored in other chat rooms (unless you click "Ignore the user"
   in those rooms also).

Instant Message->Block

   All this does is add someone to your block/ignore list.  However, if
   you have chosen something other than "Block only the users below" in
   Tools->Privacy, you will see no change in privacy behavior after
   clicking this button.
