When these are DONE, please move to the very bottom of the list.

TODO
====

See http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=2690

Working on transferring these remaining open TODO items to the Bugs
system:

- Bio Line display in chat window. (I think this can be done using
  TOPIC when the user's name is clicked.  I think yahoo may do something
  so its not editable, which would help us here.  So this could be a
  PROTOCOL PLUGIN)

- As the room list is generated, it should automatically display the multiple
  rooms associated with a locale, so that the user can select one.

- Split-phase operation notifiers. For example.... if you click to join
  a channel, there may be a delay if, for example, the buddy list is
  updating. This is NOT acceptable from a UI standpoint, since feedback
  should occur as soon as possible.  So, we need to incorporate
  notification dialogs for these operations, to give the user instant
  feedback. 

- Thumbnail in "chat" windows for selected user. Again -- this will need
  to be a separate plugin, since it will require gtk-specific code (most
  likely) (gaim developers seem to be working on this now)

- Room namelist sorting -- another non-proto option. I'm not even sure
  if a plugin can affect this, based on the way it seems to be
  implemented :( Might end up being a wish on gaim.sourceforge.net. Or
  I'll just write a damned patch myself.

- "Extended" profiles -- get the entire profile "meat" without all of
  the gay.com advertising and bric-a-brac.

- Progress bar hang on roomlist...use g_idle_add ()

- Private photo doesn't show next to buddy when I have been given
  permission to see it

- check if there is another way to retrieve thumbnails without the extra
  signal connect

- handle all "unknowns" shown in the debug window

- Getting these in red, not sure what it is: gaim_utf8_strcasecmp: One
  or both parameters are invalid UTF8  (still valid?)

DONE
====

- Need a better way to coordinate VERSION between configure.ac an win32
  builds (which do not currently use autoconf).  Perhaps win32 can
  eventually use autoconf/automake, but I don't yet know how
  cross-compiler builds would work with this.

- NOTE:  This item was found to be ineffective and not committed,
  instead, a challenge / response system was put in its place.  Add
  gaym_bot_check(), patterned similar to gaym_privacy_check() that takes
  a list of strings/patterns the user can enter in GayM preferences and
  then looks to see if a match is found in the nick's bio.  If there is,
  returns TRUE (or FALSE?), if not, then the opposite.  NOTE:  This was
  found to be ineffective and not done, instead, a challenge / response
  system was put in its place.

- Add windows installer package

- Connect link to web page for report user to Warn button in Gaim

- Activate privacy/block users in gui, synchronize ignore/deny lists
  between server and client.  Activation of Gaim's prpl privacy API is
  complete.

- Join/part message on/off

- make roomlist show "room name:1" similar to yahoo

- see what native2ascii does when the native file has "\u00F1" in it
  along with the actual character that that sequence represents.
