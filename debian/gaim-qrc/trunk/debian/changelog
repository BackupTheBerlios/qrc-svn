    things, rooms containing special characters should now be displayed
    properly.

gaim-gaym (0.21+20050513-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added gaym.png which I made under the GNU Public License (GPL).
    Hopefully someone else can make a better GPL'd one, since mine
    sucks.

gaim-gaym (0.21+20050513-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Worked a little more on the configure issues.  Not that I know that
    much about autoconf.
  * The title of rooms no longer have to be 'fixed' every time someone
    goes in and out of a room.  This also eliminates conflicts related
    to the notification plugin.
  * Added retrieval of Member Created rooms to the roomlist.
  * Added notification to the user for when the server is too busy to
    retrieve the roomlist (Member Created rooms).
  * Allow the #channel to be visible along with the room name.
  * Give more control regarding which instance of a room is joined.
    Currently (based on gay.com's own client) this amounts to instances
    1 through 4 of every room in the static list.
